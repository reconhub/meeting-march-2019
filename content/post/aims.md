The main aim of this three-day workshop will be to accelerate and expand
processes relating to the development and dissemination of data collection and
analysis resources to support outbreak response and humanitarian health
emergency activities in low and middle income countries (LMICs), with particular
attention to capacity strengthening and development of new research partnerships
across different institutions and countries. It will provide an opportunity for
participants to share views and experience in operational data collection and
analytics, and foster partnerships between respective organisations with a
strong emphasis on leadership from partners in LMICs. By the end of this
meeting, we plan on drafting a report, reviewing gaps, challenges and
recommendations, as well as an outline of a strategic roadmap for future
projects and partnerships.


The meeting will be highly interactive and attendees will be representing a wide
array of stakeholders including those from operational organisations, academia,
Field-Epidemiology Training Programmes and funding bodies, all of which have a
strong track record of supporting outbreak response and humanitarian emergency
activities.
