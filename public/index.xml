      <description>The main aim of this three-day workshop will be to accelerate and expand processes relating to the development and dissemination of data collection and analysis resources to support outbreak response and humanitarian health emergency activities in low and middle income countries (LMICs), with particular attention to capacity strengthening and development of new operational research partnerships across different institutions and countries. It will provide an opportunity for participants to share views and experience in operational data collection and analytics, and foster partnerships between respective organisations with a strong emphasis on leadership from partners in LMICs.</description>
